Hi, I'm Hugh! I'm a computer engineer, currently working on my PhD with the [Shastri Lab](https://www.queensu.ca/physics/shastrilab/) at Queen's University in Kingston. If you've found my website, thanks for your interest! You may have noticed that I'm still working on it, but don't hesitate to get in touch through any of the links on the left under my picture. 

Our lab works on implementing the ideas of neuromorphic computing in the rapidly advancing field of silicon photonics. Some things I work on: experimental demos of silicon photonic chips, design of RF PCBs for packaging photonic systems, programming photonics simulations and machine learning models in Python. Much of my work is experimental in nature, but I'm fundamentally driven by my curiosity about intelligent systems and what it takes to advance artificially intelligent systems beyond what has been possible today with current computing architectures as the pace of Moore's law wanes.

Outside of the lab
======
In my time outside of work, I like to get outside as much as I can, read good books (fiction to imagine beautiful new worlds and nonfiction to keep me grounded in this one), laugh with friends, and try not to take life too seriously. One of my biggest outdoor passions is skiing, but coming from Alberta it's hard to find the motivation to get out to Ontario's mountains so I find myself working on new challenges. Most recently these have been bouldering and kayaking but you'll also find me skateboarding, canoeing, hiking, and camping. Let me know if you want to join me!
