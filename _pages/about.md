Hi, I'm Hugh! I'm a computer hardware engineer currently working on my PhD with the [Shastri Lab](https://www.queensu.ca/physics/shastrilab/) at Queen's University in Kingston. This website is still incomplete, but don't hesitate to get in touch through any of the links on the left under my picture if you want to know more about projects I've worked on!

Our lab works on implementing the ideas of neuromorphic computing in the rapidly advancing field of silicon photonics. Some things I work on include experimental demos of silicon photonic chips, design of RF PCBs for packaging photonic systems, and programming photonics simulations and machine learning models in Python. Much of my work is experimental in nature, but I'm fundamentally driven by my curiosity about intelligent systems and what it takes to advance artificially intelligent systems beyond what has been possible today with current digital computing architectures.

I'm really passionate about anything related to computers, ideas related to artificial cognition and consciousness, and I think technology is showing us that humanity has a really bright future.

Outside of the lab
======
In my time outside of work, I still like to work on electronics and programming projects (what can I say... I like computers ðŸ˜…). Other than that, I like to get outside as much as I can, read good books, and try not to take life too seriously. One of my biggest outdoor passions is skiing, but coming from Alberta it's hard to find the motivation to get out to Ontario's mountains (if you can call them that ðŸ˜‰) so I find myself working on new challenges. Most recently these have been bouldering and kayaking but you'll also find me skateboarding, canoeing, hiking, and camping.
