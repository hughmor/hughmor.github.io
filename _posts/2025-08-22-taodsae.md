---

I'm currently reading through Richard Hamming's "The Art of Doing Science and Engineering". It's a fascinating account of Hamming's philosophy and approach toward tackling hard, technical problems, and coming up with creative solutions.
I'm still in the midst of the book, but there have been a couple of quotes so far I've felt compelled to make sure I write down.

## creativity

This is a great chapter on Hamming's process of cultivating creativity. The idea that creativity is something that can be cultivated and not an inherent trait is a great insight in itself, often lost in typical discussion. I pulled together a few quotes/passages that I want to try to remind myself about.

### how to leverage the subconscious mind
I really like this passage from p. 328 on how to focus your subconscious mind on solving a problem:

> If the solution does come from the subconscious, what can we do to manage our subconscious? My method [...] is to saturate the subconscious with the problem, try to not think seriously about anything else for hours, days, or even weeks, and thus the subconscious---which, so far as we know, depends heavily upon live experiences to form its dreams, etc.---is then left with only the problem to mull over. We simply deprive it of all else as best we can! Hence one day we have the solution, either as we awake, or it pops into our mind without any preparation on our part, or as we pick up the problem again there the solution is! In a way, I am repeating Pasteur, "Luck favours the prepared mind." You prepare your mind for success "by thinking of it constantly" (Newton), and occasionally you are lucky.

This passage struck me, and it resonates with my recollection of times in university where I was able to leverage my subconscious; my method was to obsess over the problem, read through all the relevant course notes, and debate it with my friends, but then leave to go have a good night's sleep. If I was ruminating over the problem as I went to bed, it was often the thing my mind worked on in my sleep. I've found that these types of moments have become more rare over the years---which makes sense as my personal life took on an increasing number of cycles---but the times when they do still occur come when I have relatively little else going on, and I can truly convince my mind that the problem is the only thing to worry about.

<!-- This highlights how it is important to set up your life in such a way where you can leverage this strategy. It's imperative if cultivating these moments of insight is your main goal to set your life into order, through your choices and habits, such that personal dramas occupy less of your active mental bandwidth. -->

### external motivation
I really hate how much I relate to the passage on p. 330:

> In the past I have deliberately managed myself [...] by promising a result by a given date, and then, like a cornered rat, having at the last minute to find something! I have been surprised at how often this simple trick of managing myself has worked for me. -->

### life advice

> Back to the topic of whether we can teach creativity or not. [...] It cannot be done with simple tricks and easy methods; what must be done is *you must change yourself* to be more creative. As I have thought about it in the past, I realize how often I have tried to change myself so I was more as I wished I were and less as I had been. (Often I did not succeed!) Changing oneself is not easy, as anyone who has gone on a diet to lose weight can testify; but that you can indeed change yourself is also evident from the few who do succeed in dieting, quitting smoking, and other changes in habits. We are in a very real sense, the sum total of our habits, and nothing more; hence by changing our habits, once we understand which ones we should change and in what directions, and understand our limitations in changing ourselves, then we are on the path along which we want to go.
> 
> In planning to change yourself clearly, the old Greek saying applies: "Know thyself." And do not try heroic reformations which are almost certain to fail. Practice on small ones until you gradually build up your ability to change yourself in the larger things. You must learn to walk before you can run in this matter of being creative, but I believe it can be done.

This one really hits home as I read it too. I've currently just begun to change myself into a person who goes to the gym.   -->
